Since TryHackMe only has an API for instructors and those apart of the business/classroom package. 
There's no API open to the public, so I thought I'd make my own way to obtain information on my global ranking

This StatTracker project is mainly a means for me to improve my development skills
A way in which I can improve my webscraping capabalities and a method in which I can then perform data science on

rank-tracker.py:
- Pulls global ranking from TryHackMe.com
- Stores rank
- Stores when rank change occured
- Displays change of rank dynamically

Future Plans:

Later on after I've collected enough data to perform data science on the data collected through my webscraping project
I plan on creating a different application that: 
- Displays rate of improval 
- Displays record best improved months
- Displays all time top position
- Displays change in rank on a month by month basis
