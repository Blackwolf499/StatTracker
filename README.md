Since TryHackMe only has an API for instructors and those apart of the business/classroom package. 
There's no API open to the public, so I thought I'd make my own way to obtain information on my ranking

This StatTracker project is mainly a means for me to improve my developing skills
A way in which I can improve my webscraping capabalities and a method in which I can then perform data science on
Saves global ranking for TryHackMe.com for statistical purposes.

Later on after I've collected enough data to perform data science on the data collected through my webscraping project
I plan on creating a different application that showcases rate of improval, how much my rank climbs by, etc.
