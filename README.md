This StatTracker is primarily to improve my python programming. 
I wanted to learn webscraping using selenium.
Saves global ranking for TryHackMe.com

Later on after I've collected enough data to perform data science on the data collected through my webscraping project
I plan on creating a different application that showcases rate of improval, how much my rank climbs by, etc.
